    <h1> A short Report</h1>
    <h2> TEAM 17</h2>
    <h3>  Our Efforts on the project</h3>
    <p> After the first deadline (the specification document for the API) we met on discord and decided what technologies we would be using. Because one of us had more knowledge on this topic
        we decided to work in node js and express on our back-end and Sqlite3 for the database. For the front-end we worked in HTML with javascript. Some of us had previous experience with these frameworks and
        languages and for some of us it was the first time.
    </p>
    <h3>  The Outcomes of all Milestone </h3>
    <p> All the milestones were finished on time with all the requirements being met by each of the deadlines. The first milestone (M1) was finished in a short amount of time with the help of the tutorials.
        It was the second milestone (M2)that took the longest. We struggled in the beginning until we managed to get it. We finished it in the end by helping each other out.
        Lastly the third Milestone was divided in two. We firstly managed to implement some front-end functionalities and afterwards made a deployable application. After the third deadline we managed to finish our front-end in time.
     </p>
     <h3> The Distribution of Work among Group Members</h3>
     <p> We tried to distribute the work equally even if sometimes we didn't know how. A whatsapp groupchat was created where everyone stated what they would do and when they had the time.
        We communicated well with each other and sought help if we needed it. We mainly raised issues on github if we had any qustions and our work was either shared on github or in the whatsapp chat.
        Thank you!
