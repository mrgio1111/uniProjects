# RTS

During my university studies, I successfully completed a comprehensive project that involved the creation of a battle simulator with a thematic focus on the 'Lord of the Rings'. This sophisticated application was designed to provide users with an interactive editor for creating and customizing maps composed of diverse locations and routes, upon which they could place and manage armies, and then simulate complex battle scenarios.

The core of the project revolved around the effective use of an undirected graph data structure, representing the game world where nodes symbolized significant locations and edges marked routes between them. Armies, configured by the user, could traverse these routes and engage in encounters or battles based on the user-defined events.

I built the user interface using Java Swing, not just for its aesthetic potential, but also for its robustness and the depth it offers in understanding underlying GUI mechanics. This experience has equipped me with a solid base for future GUI-based projects and an understanding of large applications that employ Swing, like IntelliJ.

The project was divided into two main components: developing the user interface, and implementing the simulation's intricate logic and features. This dual aspect of the project required a strong emphasis on initial design and planning to ensure smooth integration of various features without necessitating major rewrites.

In addition to the programming tasks, the project required the creation of a comprehensive report documenting the development process and design decisions, further honing my ability to clearly and effectively communicate complex technical concepts.

Key skills demonstrated through this project include Java programming, GUI development with Java Swing, use of MVC design pattern, Java IO, graph data structures, and project planning and documentation. This project showcases my ability to handle complex programming tasks and produce a user-friendly, functional and customizable application.
