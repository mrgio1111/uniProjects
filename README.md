# RPG

In this assignment, I created my own text-based RPG. A text-based RPG is an RPG played by interacting with a virtual world through text using System.in and System.out. This assignment helped me become familiar with inheritance and polymorphism.

In the RPG, I acted as the player and embarked on a dungeon-crawling adventure. I navigated through various rooms and encountered fascinating creatures along the way. The ultimate goal was to reach the final room and achieve eternal fame and glory (if I knew how to program that).

Throughout the assignment, I continuously extended my program with new functionalities, emphasizing the importance of a well-thought-out design.
