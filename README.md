# Web Engineering 2022-23 Project Description  

This is a group project for 2-3 students to practice web engineering concepts discussed in lectures and tutorials. The project aims to develop a web application based on the Spotify 1921-2020 dataset, specifically the songs statistics set available at Kaggle. The dataset is available in CSV format and is relatively large, so it needs to be processed before incorporation into the application. The project has three milestones with associated deliverables and deadlines.

As part of a collaborative group project, my team and I developed a comprehensive web application based on the Spotify 1921-2020 dataset, which is a large dataset containing song statistics. The project provided us with the opportunity to put into practice web engineering concepts learned during lectures and tutorials.

The aim of this project was to deliver both basic and advanced features based on the Spotify dataset. We designed a RESTful API with six functionalities, ensuring each API endpoint supported both JSON and CSV representations of the resources. We documented the API extensively, including the name, functionality, access methods, accepted and returned representations, and error information.

Following the API design phase, we successfully implemented the API to serve as the back-end of the app using our chosen technologies and programming languages. During this process, we ensured that the implementation code was thoroughly documented, and any deviations from the initial API design were updated in the API documentation.

In the final phase, we implemented a front-end user interface for the web application, which interacted seamlessly with the implemented API. All functionalities designed and implemented were easily accessible through the user interface. We also provided comprehensive documentation for the application, including a project report detailing our efforts, outcomes, and work distribution.

The project was delivered through a private GitHub repository, and we ensured that the web application could be independently deployed using only the provided documentation and scripts. The project was assessed based on the software, documentation, and demonstrable functionality, and it received a score of 7/10.

Key skills demonstrated in this project include web application development, RESTful API design and implementation, front-end user interface development, project planning, and team collaboration. This project shows my ability to work in a team to design, implement, and document a complete web application, from the back-end API to the front-end user interface.
