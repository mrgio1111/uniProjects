# RPG

In this assignment, I created my own text-based RPG. A text-based RPG is an RPG played by interacting with a virtual world through text using System.in and System.out. This assignment helped me become familiar with inheritance and polymorphism.

In the RPG, I acted as the player and embarked on a dungeon-crawling adventure. I navigated through various rooms and encountered fascinating creatures along the way. The ultimate goal was to reach the final room and achieve eternal fame and glory (if I knew how to program that).

Unlike the first assignment, not everything was explained in extensive detail. I had to make most of the implementation decisions myself. The reader provided explanations for several essential aspects, so I made sure to read through the entire chapter on "OOP Concepts" before starting the assignment. This helped me grasp the concepts and made the implementation significantly easier.

Throughout the assignment, I continuously extended my program with new functionality, emphasizing the importance of a well-thought-out design. The better the program's design, the easier it was to add new features. Since this was one of my first major projects utilizing OOP, I didn't hesitate to seek help from my TA. They were always available to assist me on this journey.
