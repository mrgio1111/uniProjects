# RPG

In one of my university projects, I successfully designed and implemented a text-based Role Playing Game (RPG), providing an immersive virtual world simulated via text interactions through System.in and System.out in Java.

In this game, the user, playing as a character embarks on a dungeon-crawling adventure, traversing through various rooms, and encountering diverse creatures. The aim of the game is to navigate through the world and reach the final room to accomplish the ultimate goal - achieving eternal fame and glory.

The game was built around the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, which were critical in creating a structured and expandable object-oriented design. The game's world included various types of rooms, characters, and interactions, each represented as different classes and subclasses, showcasing the power and flexibility of object-oriented programming in Java.

Throughout the development process, the project was continually expanded with new functionalities, which underlined the importance of having a well-thought-out initial design to accommodate future expansions seamlessly. This process taught me valuable lessons in software design and the importance of forward-thinking in the early stages of a project.

The key skills demonstrated in this project include Java programming, object-oriented design, use of inheritance and polymorphism, game design, and effective project planning. This project serves as a testament to my ability to design and implement complex, interactive applications and to expand upon a foundational codebase while maintaining a coherent and efficient structure.
